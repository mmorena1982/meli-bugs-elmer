# MeLi Challenge - Bugs and Elmer

## Requirements

 - VS Code
 - .Net Core SDK

## About the app
The app is structured qith 3 main classes:

 - Animal (abstract)
 - Gun (abstract)
 - Hunter

Implementing derived classes from Animal and Gun requires to implement several methods and properties to set possible max health for each animal, and other properties like weight, height and age. 
For a gun you must to set the GunDamage, 

If an animal is instantiated without parameters, the animal class logic takes the min and max values for each property and randomize it. Then, through a calculation resolves the animal health.

I try to find a multiple correlation index from the data provided but the R-squared indicates non relation between animals and its health.

## Running the app
